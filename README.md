## Patient no show data

## Summary
Patient physician appointment no-shows are a prevalent problem in health care services leading to inefficient resources and poor continuity of care.

This analysis explores data provided on scheduled appointments from a Brazilian public primary care setting.(1)

Questions we might propose:
1. Are there differences between males and females or differences in patient age when it comes to doctor appointments?
2. Are some patients more likely to be no shows (Age, comorbidity, neighborhood of appointment...)?
3. Is there a combination of features that makes a patient more likely to no show (i.e., Age plus comorbidity)?
